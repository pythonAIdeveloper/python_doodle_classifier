# python_doodle_classifier
It is newral network which can identify what the user has drawn. It is made in python3 and does not use any other libraries than the inbuilt libraries or modules in python(random and time modules).
I learnt how to make this from Dan Shiffman via his youtube channel (The Coding Train)(It is an awesome channel check it out if you like programming related stuff).BUT, this project also includes newral networks that can have multiply hidden layers.
The newral network library i made has been used in "DARVIS.py" that is a doodle classifier.
The data i.e the training data and the testing data have been taken from the coding train toy newral network repository which were indeed taken from the google quick draw dataset.
